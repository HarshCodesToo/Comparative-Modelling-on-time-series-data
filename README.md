# Time series analysis and LandSlide Prediction
Its a research project based on comparative Time Series analysis in the context of Landslides.

# Models Compared
Facebook Prophet

LSTM

XGBOOST

ARIMA

VAR

VARIMAX

We have also compared the techniques like conversion of numeric data into images in order to perform CNN modelling and figure out if this technique works well for real life predictions.

Each folder(city1 and city2) represents various cities from which the data is obtained and each city station represents specific location in that particular city.
